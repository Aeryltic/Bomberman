# Bomberman
It's not really a Bomberman but an Entity-Component-System Engine with Goal-Oriented AI done through Lua scripts. My goal is to create modular and dynamic engine that does not need to be modified on C++ lvl - just configured and all object definitions packed as pure data (if anything I just said makes any sense) using tools i'll create. I guess it will be slow, but I want to achieve those goals anyway.
